  "Sun": `
   The Sun is the blazing heart of our solar system, a massive sphere of plasma whose constant activity orchestrates the motion of all the planets. Its internal structure is dominated by nuclear fusion in its core, where hydrogen is converted into helium, releasing an enormous amount of energy—equivalent to 100 billion nuclear bombs every second—that bathes our system in light and warmth. The visible surface, or photosphere, displays sunspots that testify to its magnetic activity, with some sunspots large enough to swallow Earth whole. Above the photosphere lies the chromosphere, a layer of superheated gas that occasionally erupts in spectacular solar flares, while the extended outer corona, reaching temperatures of over a million degrees Celsius, remains shrouded in mystery. 
   With a diameter roughly 109 times that of Earth and accounting for more than 99% of the solar system’s total mass, the Sun sets the climatic conditions and orbital paths for the planets. Its gravitational influence also shapes the solar wind, a stream of charged particles traveling at speeds of up to 900 kilometers per second, which interacts with planetary atmospheres, creating auroras and even affecting our communication networks. The Sun’s magnetic field, which flips polarity every 11 years during the solar cycle, drives this dynamic behavior. 
   Missions such as the Parker Solar Probe, which has "touched" the Sun by flying through its corona, and the SOHO satellite have enabled us to observe solar eruptions, coronal mass ejections, and solar winds up close, enhancing our understanding of solar activity and its impacts on Earth.
